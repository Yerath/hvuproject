Who in all his work sees God, he in truth goes unto God....
He is the never-created Creator of all: he knows all, ... the creator of all time.... From him comes the transmigration of life and liberation: bondage in time and freedom Eternity.
The transmigration of life, takes place in oneï¿½s own mind. Let one therefore keep the mind pure, for what a man thinks that he becomes: this is a mystery of Eternity.
The Spirit, without moving, is swifter than the mind; the senses cannot reach him: He is ever beyond them. ...
... the Spirit though one, takes new forms in all things that live. He is within all, and is also outside.
The Spirit that is in all beings is immortal in them all: for the death of what cannot die, cease thou to sorrow.
At the moment of death the sum of all the experiences of life on earth comes to the surface of the mind-for in the mind are stored all the impressions of past deeds and the dying man then becomes absorbed in these experiences.
